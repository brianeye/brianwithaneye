Shire Pharamceuticals came to Intouch Solutions to work on a new digital presence for their drug Vyvanse. The site, before the update, was dated and was in a dire need of an update. While working with the team of creatives behind this initiative, they also gave us, developers, creative freedoms to throw in some of our own ideas. One of the cool things on this project was that I was introduced to Lottie. Lottie is javascript library developed by Airbnb. It allows the capability of creating really cool animations from after effects that can be activated on hover, or when it enters the screen. The logo and some other icons across the site, utilize this awesome plugin.
