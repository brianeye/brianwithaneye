Shire Pharamceuticals came to Intouch Solutions to work on the full branding and digital presence for their new drug for ADHD named Mydayis (pronounced My-day-is). While working with the team of creatives behind this initiative, they also gave us, developers, creative freedoms to throw in some of our own ideas. Luckily, I had a few things up my sleeve that I had been itching to put on a project. When you visit the site, the footer has a curtain effect where it appears behind the actual body of the site. The mobile hamburger menu icon uses a javascript library called Velocity to aide in it's animation. I was also able to work on the beads on the How it works page. I got to design those and animate them. Which for me, was huge. And lastly, the squirrel on the Know ADHD page. That is the easter egg of the site. I had a lot of fun working on that. Just click on the squirrel to see what it does.
