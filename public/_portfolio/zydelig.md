Gilead came to Intouch Solutions to work on a new web presence for their drug Zydelig. This site did have a pretty challenging thing to make work across devices. There are words that are a bold purple which if you hover over them, definition windows pop up. The trouble was making those stay in the correct position when changing the window size. Luckily, I was able to pull in another developer to bring in a different view, and we came up with a solution that works.
