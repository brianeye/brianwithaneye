Citizen Hops was brand idea that I came up with quite a few years ago and never followed through with. I always had this vision of this being a beer brand that really didn't brew any beer, but just focused on t-shirts
and other swag. When I would show this idea to others, they loved the name and the logo. They thought it was really unique. And they loved the ideas that I had come up with for it. who knows, maybe one day I'll turn this into an actual thing. I still have a lot of ideas for it. Below are just a few of the t-shirt ideas that I came up with.
