Galderma came to Intouch Solutions to work on a new website for their new acne product, Differin. This was the first project that I was put on when I started at Intouch Solutions. It was definitely fun, but
also felt impossible to complete considering the timeline given. But we did it. We persevered and burned the midnight oil a few times, but we had cultivated a club house vibe whilst working on this project. This site was developed in Drupal.
