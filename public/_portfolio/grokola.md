Grokola is easy-to-use wiki platform with automatic API governance, collaborative design tool, and a question and answer workflow. Keyhole came to me to come up with design for the website of this product. I immediately jumped onto it. I had to come up with the logo and overall branding of it. I decided to take an apple approach. Clean, simple and rememberable. Below are some screens of the website I came up with. Since my leaving, they have updated the site to something different.
